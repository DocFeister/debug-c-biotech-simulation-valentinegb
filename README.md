# Biotech Simulation C++ Template

The original document here is a template for a broken biotech simulation in C++. As written, main.cpp will not compile; it is riddled with syntax errors and semantic errors.

Compile and run main.cpp using the following command:
```
g++ main.cpp -o ./main.o && ./main.o
```

Feel free to change this README if you'd like!
